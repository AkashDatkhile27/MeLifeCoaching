              <p className="chapter-text">
                There was a time in my life when I was stuck in a deep fog of confusion, self-doubt, and inner chaos. Questions constantly circled my mind:
              </p>
              <ul className="questions-list">
                 <li>What’s wrong with me?</li>
                 <li>Am I weird? Am I less than others?</li>
                 <li>Why do I get so angry?</li>
                 <li>Why did I fail in 5th grade?</li>
                 <li>Why was I bullied in school?</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="chapter-text">
                So many such thoughts and emotions led me to feel small, broken, and disconnected like I just didn’t fit in.

              <h2 className="chapter-title">The Curiosity That Changed Everything</h2>
              <p className="chapter-text">
                I began seeking answers, not just to heal, but to understand why I am the way I am. Coming from a middle class family, I couldn’t always find answers at home. But that curiosity never left me.
              </p>
                <p className="chapter-text">
                In 6th grade, a life-changing teacher named Bhunje Sir introduced me to the lives and thoughts of great thinkers like Gandhi, Shaw, Einstein, and Socrates. From him, I learned something far beyond academics — I began learning how to live.
              </p>
              <p className="chapter-text">
                Somewhere along the way, I discovered the writings of Marathi literary legend Va Pu Kale — and his views on life, relationships, work, and philosophy struck something deep within me.

               <h2 className="chapter-title">Philosophy Became My Path</h2>
               <p className="chapter-text">
                 That early exposure made me realize that philosophy isn’t just theory — it’s a lens through which life makes more sense.
               </p>
               <p className="chapter-text">
                 I started learning from people who had done personal development courses. I absorbed what I could from them, and eventually began doing my own courses — and more importantly, I practiced deeply.
               </p>
               <p className="chapter-text">
                 I worked closely and voluntarily with teachers, coaches, and mentors for several years. This inner work became my foundation. I discovered tools to keep my past in the past, deal with issues powerfully, and find simplicity in thinking.

               <p className="chapter-text">
                 Then life hit harder. My father passed away. That was a very tough time for me — emotionally, mentally, and personally.
               </p>
               <p className="chapter-text">
                 Soon after, my marriage ended. I have an adorable daughter — but eventually, I went through a separation that left me shattered. Losing her regular presence was one of the most painful experiences of my life.
               </p>
               <div className="highlight-text">
                 But the inner work I had done over the years became my anchor. The same tools and awareness helped me survive that pain.

               <p className="chapter-text">
                 I never planned to become a coach — it just happened organically. Now, it’s been over 13 years, and I’ve worked with people from all walks of life.

                 But life wasn't done testing me. My father passed away suddenly. The ground beneath my feet crumbled. A relationship that I thought would last forever ended in separation.

               <p className="chapter-text">
                I was back in the fog. But this time, I had tools. The philosophy I had absorbed wasn't just theory anymore—it was lived practice
